### Project description
IP Objective: The goal of this week's Independent Project is to help us practice and understand
better the complementary JavaScript concepts that we have covered throughout this week.
You just landed yourself a great deal and acquired a farm upcountry that has dairy cattle. These
cows are well fed and they produce a fair amount of milk every day. Luckily, Brookside Dairies has
also called you in, for yet another deal to sell your milk produce to them for processing. There's one
problem though, you're very engaged in a website consultation company which leaves very little time
for you to monitor milk production at your farm.
Your cows will make you rich if you monitor their milk production and sale, and you have skills to
build a program with JavaScript, that helps you monitor production and sales. Here's a document of
what you have on your farm. Assume that this is a day's production
Brookside Dairies has signed a contract with you to buy milk at Ksh.45 per litre for one year.:
